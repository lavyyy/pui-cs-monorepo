2. Relate them
3. Differentiate
4. Plug in and solve
(Optional): DRAW A PICTURE
##### Example 1:
Spherical balloon
Inflated at a rate of 100$cm^3/s$
How fast is the radius changing when the balloon is 50cm across?

$$
\frac{dv}{dt} = 100
$$
$$
\frac{dr}{dt} = \ ?
$$
$$
r = 25
$$
Volume formula
$$
V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^2
$$
$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt}
$$
$$
100 = 4\pi(25^2) \frac{dr}{dt}
$$
$$
\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{100}{4\pi(25^2)}
$$
$$
= \frac{1}{25\pi}
$$
##### Example 2:
10 ft ladder, leaning against a wall, bottom is pulling away at 1ft/s.
When the top is 4ft from the ground, how fast is it moving?

![[Pasted image 20230927122619.png]]

Known:
$\frac{dx}{dt} = 1 ft / s$
$y = 4ft$
$x^2 + y^2 = 10^2$

Unknown:
$\frac{dy}{dt} = \ ?$

Take the derivative of our equation, but with respect to t
$$
2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0
$$
We know what y is so we can actually solve for x
$$
x^2 = 100-16
$$
$$
x = \sqrt{ 84 }
$$
Now we can plug in all our knowns into the derivative to find $\frac{dy}{dt}$
$$
2(\sqrt{ 84 })(1) + 2(4) \frac{dy}{dt} = 0
$$
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac{2\sqrt{ 84 }}{8}
$$
##### Example 3:
Inverted conical water tank
Base radius 2m, height of 4m
Water is pumped in at 2 $m^3 / min$
How fast is the water level rising when 3m filled

![[Pasted image 20230927124214.png]]

Known:
$\frac{dV}{dt} = 2 \frac{m^3}{min}$
$h = 3m$
Volume of a cone: $V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$

Unknown:
$\frac{dh}{dt} = \ ?$

We need to rewrite our volume formula so that r is in terms of h, essentially eliminating the r

$$
\frac{h}{r} = \frac{4}{2}
$$
$$
r = \frac{h}{2}
$$
So now we can substitute r
$$
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left( \frac{h}{2} \right)^2h
$$
$$
V = \frac{\pi}{12}h^3
$$
Now we can just take the derivatives
$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\pi}{4}h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
$$
Plug in knowns
$$
(2) = \frac{\pi}{4}(3)^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
$$
$$
\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{2}{\frac{\pi}{4}(3)^2}
$$
##### Example 4:
Car A traveling west at 50mph
Car B traveling north at 60mph
Both toward the same intersection
How fast are they moving toward each other when A is 0.3 mi away and B is 0.4 mi

![[Pasted image 20230927130619.png]]

Known:
$\frac{dx}{dt} = -50 mph$
$\frac{dy}{dt} = -60mph$
^ These are negative because the length from the intersection is decreasing 
x = 0.3
y = 0.4

Unknown:
$\frac{dz}{dt} = \ ?$

$$
x^2 + y^2 = z^2
$$
$$
2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 2z \frac{dz}{dt}
$$
$$
2(0.3)(-50) + 2(0.4)(-60) = 2(0.5) \frac{dz}{dt}
$$
$$
\frac{dz}{dt} = -78
$$
##### Example 5:
Airplane flying at 500mph
3mi in the air
Someone on the ground views the plane at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees.
Find how fast the angle of elevation is changing

![[Pasted image 20230929125837.png]]

Known:
$\frac{dx}{dt} = 500$mph
$\theta = 60deg$

Unknown:
$\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \ ?$

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{3}{x}
$$
We can flip both sides 
$$
\cot \theta = \frac{x}{3}
$$
$$
-\csc^2 \theta {\frac{d\theta}{dt}} = \frac{1}{3} {\frac{dx}{dt}}
$$
$$
-\left( \frac{1}{\sin 60} \right) {\frac{d\theta}{dt}} = \frac{1}{3} (500)
$$

$$
- \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{ 3 }} \right)^2 {\frac{d\theta}{dt}} = \frac{500}{3}
$$
$$
\frac{d\theta}{dt} = - \frac{500}{4} = -125 deg /hr
$$
