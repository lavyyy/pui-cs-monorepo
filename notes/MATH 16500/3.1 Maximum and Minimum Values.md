### Absolute Max/Min
---
Def: $f$ is a function
Let $c$ in the domain of $f$

$f(c) \geq f(x)$ for all $x$ values
$f(c)$ is the absolute maximum

$f(c) \leq f(x)$ for all x values
$f(c)$ is the absolute minimum

### Local Max/Min
---
$f(c) \geq f(x)$ for $x$ near $c$
$f(c)$ is a local maximum (maxima)

$f(c) \leq f(x)$ for $x$ near $c$
$f(c)$ is a local minimum (minima)


##### Example: $\cos x$

Absolute max is 1
(Local max is also 1)

Absolute min is -1
(Local min is also -1)

## Extreme Value Theorem
---
$f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$
The $f$ attain an absolute max and absolute min on $[a,b]$

## Fermat's Theorem
---
If $f$ has a local max or min at $c$ and $f'(c)$ exists, then $f'(c) = 0$
## Critical Numbers
---
A number $c$ is a critical number for $f$ if $f'(c)=0$ or $f'(c)$ does not exist

##### Example:
Find critical numbers of $f(x) = x^{\frac{3}{5}}(4-x)$

 $f(x) = x^{\frac{3}{5}}(4-x) = 4x^{\frac{3}{5}} - x^{\frac{8}{5}}$

Take the derivative:

$$
f'(x) = \frac{12}{5}x^{-\frac{3}{5}} - \frac{8}{5}x^{\frac{3}{5}}
$$

$$
\frac{12}{5} x^{-\frac{2}{5}} - \frac{8}{5}x^{\frac{3}{5}} = 0
$$

<!-- TODO: Solve other critical number-->
$$
x = \frac{12}{5}
$$
Critical points: $0$, $\frac{3}{2}$

## Closed Interval Method
---
Goal: Find absolute extrema (maxima & minima) for a continuous $f$ on $[a,b]$

1. Find the critical numbers $c$, evaluate $f(c)$ in (a,b)
2. Evaluate at the endpoints $f(a)$, $f(b)$
3. Largest is absolute max, smallest is absolute min

##### Example:

$f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 1$ where $-\frac{1}{2} \leq x \leq 4$ (can also be written as $[ -\frac{1}{2}, 4]$)


1. Find critical numbers:
Take derivative 
$$
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x
$$
Set equal to 0
$$
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x = 0
$$
Find x's

$$
3x(x-2)=0
$$
$$
3x = 0
$$
$$
x-2 = 0
$$
$$
x = 0
$$
$$
x = 2
$$
Plug into the original function
$$
f(0) = 1
$$
$$
f(2) = -3
$$
2. Evaluate at endpoints
$$
f\left(  -\frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{8}
$$
$$
f(4) = 17
$$
3. Absolute max is largest, absolute min is smallest
Absolute max is 17 at $x = 4$ 
$(4,17)$

Absolute min is -3 at $x = 2$
$(2,-3)$
