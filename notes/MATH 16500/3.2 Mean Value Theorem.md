## Rolles Theorem: $f$
---
1. $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$
2. $f$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$
3. $f(a)=f(b)$

Then there is a $c$ in $(a,b)$ so that $f'(c) = 0$

## Mean Value Theorem
---
$f$ is a function
1. $f$ is cont. on $[a,b]$
2. $f$ is diff. on $(a,b)$
Then there is a $c$ in $(a,b)$ so that $f'(c) = \frac{{f(b)-f(a)}}{b-a}$

##### Example:
$f(0) = -3$, $f'(x) \leq 5$

How large can $f(2)$ be?

There's a c in $(0,2)$
so that $f'(c) = \frac{{f(2) - f(0)}}{2-0} = \frac{{f(0) + 3}}{2} \leq 5$
$f(2) + 3 \leq 10 \to f(2) \leq 7$]
