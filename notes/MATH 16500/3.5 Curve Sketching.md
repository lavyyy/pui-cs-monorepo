## Slant Asymptotes
Does whatever in the middle, but on the ends in infinitely gets closer to a certain line
![[Pasted image 20231025124522.png]]
Happens when degree of the top $p(x)$ is one more than the bottom

##### Example:
$$
\frac{x^3}{x^2 + 1}
$$
Can be solved by polynomial long division

$$
x^2 + 1 \overline{)x^3}
$$
$$
= x - \frac{x}{x^+1}
$$
Slant asymptote: $y=x$

##### Gotcha
$$
\frac{{2x^3-2x+1}}{x+2}
$$
This does NOT have a slant asymptote because the power on the top is more than 1 greater than the bottom
