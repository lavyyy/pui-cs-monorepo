## Idea: What happens to f(x) when x gets close to some number
---
$$
\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L
$$
We can get f(x) as close to L as be want by taking x close enough to a (but not equal to a).

> [!tip] Helpful hint
> The way to think about limits is finding the minimum or maximum number that you can get to before reaching the number that its pointing to. So if the number its pointing to is 2, the minimum would be 1.999 and the maximum would be 2.001
##### Example 1:
$$
f(x) = x^2 -x +2
$$
$$
\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) =
$$
The limit from the left is 1.999
The limit from the right is 2.001

And
$$
f(1.999) = 3.997001
$$
$$
f(2.0001) = 4.0003001
$$
So we can assume that the answer to the limit is 4.

##### Example 2:
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x}
$$
Cant do this!
$$
\frac{0}{0} = undefined
$$
$$
f(\pm 0.0001) = 0.99999983
$$
We can be fairly confident that this equals 1

##### Example 3:
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \sin \frac{\pi}{x}
$$

$$
f(\pm 0.1) = \sin \frac{\pi}{\pm 0.1} = \sin 10\pi = 0
$$
This limit does not exist!

> [!note] DNE
> If you're not approaching a single number, the limit does not exist

## One-Sided Limits
---
##### Example 1: The Heaviside function
$$
H(t) = \begin{cases}
0 \ if \ t < 0 \\
1 \ if \ t \ge 0
\end{cases}
$$

$$
if \ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L 

$$
$$
then \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L
$$
## Infinite Limits
---
##### Example 1:
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x^2}
$$
$$
f(1) = 1
$$
$$
f(0.1) = 100
$$
$$
f(0.01) = 10000
$$
We are no longer getting close to a value of L, its just getting really really big. So this is equal to infinity.
$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x^2} = \infty
$$

##### Example 2:
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{x}
$$
We need to look at this from both the left and right sides
$$
\lim_{ x \to 0^+} = + \infty
$$
$$
\lim_{ x \to 0^- } = - \infty 
$$
They don't match, so the limit doesn't exist
$$
\lim_{ x \to 0 } = DNE 
$$
##### Definition: The line $x=a$ is a vertical asymptote if any limit to a is infinite

## Piecewise Limits
---
##### Theorem: If $\lim_{ x \to a } = L$ if and only if $\lim_{ y \to a^+ } = \lim_{ x \to a^- } f(x) = L$
$$
\begin{cases}
g(x) \ \text{if} \ x<a \ \\
f(x) \ \text{if} \ x> a
\end{cases}
$$
