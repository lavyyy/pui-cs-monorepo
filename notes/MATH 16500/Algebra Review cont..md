## Polynomial Long Division
---
Example 1:
$$ x-2\overline{)x^3-3x^2-10x+24}$$
Solution:
$$ f(x) = (x-2)(x^2-x-12)$$
$$ = (x-2)(x-4)(x+3) $$
>[!tip] Fact:
> If f(a) = 0 and f is a polynomial, then x-a is a factor of f.
> (Finding the zeros)

Example 2:
$$ x+1 \overline{)2x^2-3x+1} $$
Solution:
$$ 2x-5+\frac{6}{x+1} $$
> [!tip] Remainders
> If you have a remainder you can write it as $$ \frac{remainder}{dividend} $$
> The dividend being the term you're dividing by.

## Completing the Square 
---
Example 1: 
$$ 2x^2 +2x +2 $$
Take GCF
$$ 2(x^2+x+1) $$
Split first term in half and square it
$$ (\frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{4} $$
Add that term and subtract that term from the original
$$ 2(x^2 + x + \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} +1) $$
Then group it into this form
$$ = 2(x+\frac{1}{2})^2+\frac{3}{4} $$
The benefit of this is that you're easily able to graph this.

## Quadratic Formula
---
When you have a quadratic:
$$ ax^2 + bx + c $$
You can always use this formula to find the factors: 
$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} $$
## Exponents & Radicals
---

Anything to the power of zero is 1
$$ a^0 = 1 $$
When you have a negative exponent you have to flip it
$$ a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^{n}} $$
$$ \frac{1}{a^{n}} = a^{-n}$$
When you have a exponent that is a fraction you turn it into a square root
$$ a^\frac{m}{n} = (n\sqrt{a})^m$$
$$ a^\frac{1}{n} = n\sqrt{a}$$


## Laws
---
When you multiply two terms with exponents, you add the exponents
$$a^{r} \times a^{s} = a^{r+s}$$
When you divide two terms with exponents, you subtract the exponents
$$ \frac{a^{r}}{a^{s}} = a^{r-s}$$
When you have a term with an exponent raised to another exponent, you multiply the exponents
$$ (a^{r})^{s} = a^{rs} $$
When you have multiple terms multiplied together raised to a exponent, you raise everything by that power
$$ (ab)^{2} = a^{2}b^{2} $$
> [!NOTE]
> $$(a+b)^2 \neq a^r + b^r$$
> and
> $$h\sqrt{a+b} \neq \sqrt{a} + h\sqrt{b}$$ 

Example 1:
$$ \frac{x^{-2}-y^{-2}}{x^{-1}+y^{-1}}$$
Turn negative exponents into fractions
$$
\frac{\frac{1}{x^{2}} - \frac{1}{y^2}}{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}}
$$
Make common denominators
$$ \frac{\frac{y^{2} - x^{2}}{x^{2}y^{2}}}{\frac{y+x}{xy}}$$
## Rationalizing
---
#### Conjugate: 
To take the conjugate you need to flip the signs
$$ \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} $$
the conjugate is $$ 
\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b}$$
Example 1:
We cant have a radical in the numerator!!
$$ \frac{\sqrt{x+4} -2}{x}$$
Need to rationalize the numerator by multiplying everything by the conjugate
$$ = \frac{x+4 - 2\sqrt{x+4} +2\sqrt{x+4}}{x(\sqrt{x+4} +2)} $$
The square roots cancel out so it leaves us with
$$ \frac{x}{x(\sqrt{x+4} +2)}$$
The x's cancel as well so our final answer is
$$ \frac{1}{
\sqrt{x+4}+2
}$$
