## The Power Rule
---
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^h)=hx^{h-1}
$$
The derivative of constant is just 0
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(c)=0
$$
The derivative of a line or x is just 1
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x)= 1
$$
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x
$$

## Product Rule
---
When taking the derivative of 2 things multiplied together
$$fs'+ sf'$$
> [!NOTE] Remember
> First d (derivative) second plus second d first
## Quotient Rule
---
When taking the derivative of a fraction
$$ \frac{{bt' - t'b}}{b^2}$$
>[!NOTE] Remember
> Bottom d (derivative) top minus top d bottom, all over bottom squared
## Trig Derivatives
---
$$\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x)=\cos x$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}(\cos x)=\sin x$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}(\tan x)=sec^2x$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}(\sec x)=\sec x \tan x$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}(\cot x)=-\csc^2 x$$
$$\frac{d}{dx}(\csc x)=-\csc x\cot x$$
##### Example 1:
$$g(x) = \frac{{x^2\cos x}}{x-\cot x}$$
Quotient rule
$$=\frac{{(x-\cot x)[x^2\cos x]'-(x^2\cos x)[x-\cot x]'}}{(x-\cot x)^2}$$
Product rule
$$\frac{{(x-\cot x)(2x\cos x+x^2(-\sin x))-x^2\cos x(1-(-\csc^2x))}}{(x-\cot x)^2}$$
