$$
p'(t) = v(t), \ \ v'(t)= a(t)
$$
Idea: $y$ that depends on $x$
Average rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$
$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, Instantaneous Rate of Change, ${\lim_{ \Delta \to 0 }}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{{dy}}{dx}$

## Linear Density
---
mass per unit length

If we have a wire with a length $l$ and a mass $m$.

##### Example:
10m of wire weights 20kg

$$
\rho = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \frac{kg}{m}
$$
This is the average linear density.

But if we had to find the density as a specific point on the wire we need to get the instantaneous density by using a limit.

Lets say the point we're trying to find is 2m from the end (x = 2m)
$$
\lim_{ x \to 0 } \frac{\Delta m}{\Delta x} = \frac{dm}{dx}
$$
Which this is the derivative of m since x is the distance from the end

$$
m'(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^{-{\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{ x }}
$$
Then plug in x
$$
m'(2) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{ 2 }} \frac{kg}{m}
$$


## Current
---
Q -> charge "how many electrons"
$\Delta Q$ net charge passing through over 
$\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$ = average current
Current $I$ = $\lim_{ \Delta t \to 0 } \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{dQ}{dt}$

## Economics
---
$C(x)$ = cost to produce x units of a product

Marginal cost: How much does it cost to make 1 more?

$\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x}$ average increase in cost when increasing by $\Delta x$ units

Marginal cost = $\lim_{ \Delta x \to 0 } \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta x} = \frac{dC}{dx}$
