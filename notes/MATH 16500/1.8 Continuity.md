### Def: A function f is called continuous at a if the $\lim_{ x \to a } f(x) = f(a)$
- $f(a)$ is defined
- $\lim_{ x \to a } f(x)$ exists

> [!NOTE] Note
>  If f is not continuous at a then f is _discontinuous_ at a


> [!HINT] Helpful hint
> If we can draw f(x) without lifting our pencil, it is continuous 

##### Example 1:
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}
$$
This is discontinuous at 0
f(0) is undefined 

## Types of Discontinuity 
---
1. Removable: "We can remove it by redefining f(a)"
	1. Looks like a hole
	2. Happen if $\lim_{ x \to a } f(x) < \infty$ but $\neq f(a)$ 
2. Infinite:
	1. Happens if we get any infinite limit
3. Jump: "Step"
	1. $\lim_{ x \to a^- } \neq \lim_{ x \to a^+ } f(x)$ but both are finite

f is continuous from the left (right) at a if $\lim_{ x \to -a^- } f(x) = f(a)$ ( $\lim_{ x \to a^+ } f(x) = f(a)$ ) 
^ similar to limits
### Def: A function is continuous of an interval if it is continuous at every point in the interval

### Theorem: Polynomials, rational functions, trig functions, and root functions are continuous where they are defined
