What does $f'$ say about $f$?

### Increasing / Decreasing
---
If $f(x)$ is positive on an interval then $f$ is increasing on that interval
If $f(x)$ is negative on an interval then $f$ is decreasing on that interval

1. Take derivative
2. Find the critical points
3. See where they're increasing or decreasing

##### Example
$f(x) = 3x^4 - 4x^3 - 12x^2 + 5$

Find the intervals of increase and decrease.

$$
f'(x) = 12x^3 - 12x^2 - 24x
$$
$$
= 12x(x^2-x-2)
$$
$$
= 12x(x-2)(x+1)
$$
$$
x = 0, x = 2, x = -1
$$
Increase: $(-1, 1)$, $(2, \infty)$
Decreasing: $(-\infty, -1)$, $(0, 2)$

## First Derivative Test
---
1. Find intervals of increase and decrease
2. For each critical point c:
	1. If $f(x)$ changes from pos to neg then c is a local max
	2. If $f(x)$ changes from neg to pos then c is a local min
	3. If $f(x)$ has no change then c is there is no max or min
