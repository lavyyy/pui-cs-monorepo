Initialize the balance to $1000.00.

balance = 1000.00

Display a welcome message and the ATM menu options.

print("[ATM] Welcome to the ATM!")
print(" 1. Check Balance")
print(" 2. Withdraw")
print(" 3. Deposit")
print(" 4. Quit")

Prompt the user to make a selection and store their choice.
choice = int(input("Please make your selection: "))

Depending on the user's choice, perform one of the following actions:
If the choice is 1, call the check_balance function.
If the choice is 2, call the withdraw function and update the balance.
If the choice is 3, call the deposit function and update the balance.
If the choice is 4, exit the program.

if choice == 1:
    check_balance(balance)
elif choice == 2:
    balance = withdraw(balance)
elif choice == 3:
    balance = deposit(balance)
elif choice == 4:
    return
else:
    print("[ATM] Invalid choice. Please try again.")
    main()  # Recursively call the main function to re-display the menu.

Implement the check_balance function, which displays the current balance.
def check_balance(balance):
    print("[ATM] Your balance is $" + str(balance) + ".")

Implement the withdraw function, which asks the user for the withdrawal amount, checks if they have sufficient funds, and updates the balance.
def withdraw(balance):
    amount = float(input("[ATM] How much would you like to withdraw? $"))
    if amount > balance:
        print("[ATM] You do not have enough money to withdraw that amount.")
        return balance
    else:
        balance -= amount
        print("[ATM] You have withdrawn $" + str(amount) + ".")
        return balance

Implement the deposit function, which asks the user for the deposit amount and updates the balance.

def deposit(balance):
    amount = float(input("[ATM] How much would you like to deposit? $"))
    balance += amount
    print("[ATM] You have deposited $" + str(amount) + ".")
    return balance

Run the main function.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
